1.what is statically typed and Dynamically typed Programming Language?

Statically typed Vs Dynamically typed
statically typed:Programming languages are referred to as "static typed"
if the memory of the variable is provided at the time of compilation .
for instance,c,c++,and java

Dynamically typed: Programming languages are said to as "dynamically typed "
