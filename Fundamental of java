What is programming language ?
A programming language is a set of instructions that a computer can understand and execute.
It is a way for humans to communicate with computers by writing code that tells the computer what to do.
There are many different programming languages, each with its own syntax and features, 
but they all serve the same basic purpose of allowing people to create software and automate tasks.

Why do we need a programming language?
We need programming languages because they allow us to give instructions to computers in a way
that is understandable by both humans and machines.
Without programming languages, we would not be able to create software or automate tasks.

what are the features of java?
Java is a popular programming language with many features, including platform independence,
object-oriented programming, automatic memory management, strong type checking, multi-threading,
and rich libraries.It is widely used for developing a variety of applications and software.

what is an object ?
In programming, an object is an instance of a class that defines the characteristics and behavior
of that object. Objects allow developers to encapsulate data and behavior into a single entity, 
making it easier to manage and manipulate. They are a fundamental concept in
object-oriented programming and enable reusable code that can be adapted to different situations.

what is a class?
In programming, a class is a blueprint or template that defines a set of properties and methods
common to all objects of that class. It provides a way to organize and structure code and allows
developers to create reusable code that can be easily adapted to different situations. Classes are
important in object-oriented programming because they enable encapsulation of data and behavior,
making code easier to manage and maintain. By creating instances of a class, developers
can create multiple objects with their own unique values for the properties defined in the class.

Explain about the main() method in java ?
In Java, main() is the entry point for a program, where the execution begins. It is a required
method in all Java programs, and it must be declared as public, static, and void. The method takes
an array of String objects as a parameter and can be used to pass command-line arguments to the
program.
